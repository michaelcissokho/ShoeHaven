# ShoeHaven

I created my own API to be used by the front end of this application. The title of the site is called ShoeHaven and it serves as an online marketplace for people who want to second hand buy and sell shoes. I haven't deployed this application yet so there is no url to post. I haven't added tests to the application yet but hope to add them in the coming days.

The standard user flow through the website begins with a user signing up on the signup page and being redirected to the home page which is where listings are. The user will then click on a listing to add to their cart and then go to the cart where they can checkout or remove items from their cart. If they click the checkout link they will be redirected to the checkout page where payment processing is not implemented but does show a form where in the future I can add this process. THe form is submitted and the items are marked sold in our database. 

The other user flow involves going to the community page where you can write posts and comment on other posts that already exist. That process involves clicking the "create new post" link and filling out the form to enter your information for the post or you can view posts that already exist and click on the button to "add a comment" where the user will be sent to a page to fill out the form.

The process for creating the api involved having different classes to access the individual databases, creating pages for routes that will call the methods on those classes and then returning information to the client. The process was quite long as this was my first express backend and react front end application and I hope it won't be my last as I learned a lot from the experience. 

I really hope that anyone viewing this application or trying to use it sees potential in me as a future software developper as I feel I am learning tech stacks as well as application design strategies more and more every day. 

Thank You,
